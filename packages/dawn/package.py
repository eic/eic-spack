    """ Fukui  Renderer   DAWN (Drawer for Academic WritiNgs) 
    is a renderer, which reads 3D geometrical data and visualize them.  
    It is a vectorized 3D PostScript processor with analytical 
    hidden line/surface removal. 
    It aims at precise technical drawing of complex geometries.  
    It performs geometrical hidden line/surface removal and calculates 
    out all visible parts of the 3D data before drawing.  This drawing 
    algorithm realizes device-independent technical high quality of
    vectorized graphics.
    3D Data files should be generated by a modeler or by hands 
    separately.  If you use DAWN as a visualizer of, 
    say, a simulator of physical experiments, 
    the simulator application itself is recognized as a modeler.
    An important feature of DAWN is that
    it has been developed to visualize 3D data generated by
    a high-energy experimental detector simulator "GEANT4" 
    ( http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4 , http://geant4.kek.jp ).  

    Note: we set 'gv' as default pdf/ps viewer, assuming this is
          installed on your system.
